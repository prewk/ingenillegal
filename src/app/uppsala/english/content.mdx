### Who are we?

We are an organization that works with practically supporting undocumented people in Uppsala with food, accommodation, bus card, other living expenses, healthcare contacts and social contacts. Our goal is a permanent residence permit for everyone who is in Sweden and wants to stay here. We believe in a world without national borders, a world where no one is illegal.

### What do we do?

Our goal is to be a support for the people who have been forced to go underground after having been rejected on their asylum application, in order to make their life as safe as possible. All those we support also have at least one contact person in the network who can help get legal help, to contact the healthcare or to be a social support. In addition to supporting people, we have various events such as fikas, brunches, poetry evenings or dance nights to collect money that always goes entirely to the ones we support. Everyone in the network works completely voluntarily.

### How can I help?

We always need more volunteers, because at at the moment many people are asking for our help, and often we are forced to say no because we do not have enough resources.
You can get involved with us by:

- Becoming a contact person for someone who is undocumented. Then you help the person with individual needs like healthcare contacts, pass on questions that you cannot answer yourself to the network and give money from the network to the person.
- Help out with events! We always need more people who can help to plan and arrange events, often many volunteers are needed who can bake, put up posters or set up arrangements.
- Raise political awareness for undocumented peoples’ situation and work to strengthen their rights.
- Support us financially! We and our contacts rely entirely on our donors, and the more monthly donors we have, the more people we can take on. Or come to our events a buy a coffee! And if you can, please round up.
- Do you have extra space at home? One of the most common questions we get is from people who need help with accommodation. So if you have a room to lend for a shorter or longer period, talk to us! Contact us also if you want to rent out your accommodation.
